## Project Based
One Project controls everything in Ignition Designer. That means you only deploy in one place and connect everything else to that Ignition server. No separate install for the Designer. You can have as many Connectors as you want, no installation necessary.

## Simple Licensing
One license for the Ignition server gives you unlimited access. Unlimited Clients, unlimited Tags, and unlimited Projects. With unlimited run-time clients at no additional cost, you can get your important data and analytics to your entire team, across your whole company. It allows you to create and use as many tags as you need for devices, OPC servers, and anything else, without limit

## Web-based Deployment
it is installed, deployed, and managed using standard web technologies. Connect and change settings, update projects, all from any computer on the network.
